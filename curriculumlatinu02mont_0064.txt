LATIN CLASSICS.

(IHEAP COLONJAL EDlTloNS
FOR

COLLEGES AND SCHOOLS.

 

Although the great improvements in the Printing Art have
done so much to add to the appearance os Books, and also to
diminish the cost, yet the price still forms rather a serious item in
the expense os education. This is particularly the case in editions
os the Greek and Latin Classics. There is no want os excellence in
many ol* these, but they are generally either so comprehensive or so
extendet] by annotations, that the price is an obstacle to those who,
entertaining enlarged views of the advantages of education‚ have not
means commensurate with tneir wishes. It is, therefore, the inten-
tion os the Subscribers, to publish neat and correct editions os such
detached portions os the Classic authors as are usually read in
schools and Colleges. This plan has been tried in England, and hau
been attended with marked success.

The success which attended this experiment to improve and
render unisorni the Books used in the common Schools os Canada,
has emboldened the Subscribers to undertake the publication os the
Classical series now announced sor the use os colleges‚ High Schools,
District and Grammar Schools.

The first numbers os the series will consist os the following :—

Excerpts from Cornelius Nepos.

The First Four Books os Caesar.

The Georgics os virgil.

The Fasti os ovid.

The Third and Fourth Books os Quintus Curtius.
Cicero de Amicitia.

Cicero de Senectute.

Taciti Agricola.

Excerpts from Horace.

The F‘irst Three Books os the AEneid.

The price of each will vary from 9d. to ls. 9d. cumncy, ac-
cording to the quantity os printed matter in each.

Orders sor copies will be executed by the Booksellero through·

out Canada, or by the Publishen.
